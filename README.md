# Invivosyn (R)
## Determine BLISS or HSA synergy from longitudinal, IVIS luminiscent based, in vivo data 

R software package invivosyn(1) which can assess the combination index and synergy score using the Bliss independence model as well as the highest single agent (HSA) model. The model does not make any assumption on tumor growth kinetics, study duration, data completeness and balance for tumor volume measurement. The used script is provided.
